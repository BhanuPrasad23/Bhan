Scientific Calculator with GUI
A Python-based Scientific Calculator built with the Tkinter library, designed to perform both basic arithmetic and advanced mathematical computations in a user-friendly graphical interface.

✨ Features
🔢 Basic Arithmetic Operations
Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)
📐 Advanced Mathematical Functions
Square Root (√): Calculate square root values.
Exponentiation (^): Perform power operations.
Logarithmic Functions:
log: Base-10 logarithm.
ln: Natural logarithm (base e).
Trigonometric Functions:
sin, cos, tan: Compute trigonometric values for angles (in degrees).
Factorial (!): Calculate the factorial of integers.
🚫 Error Handling
Gracefully handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric input, division by zero).
Displays clear error messages in a pop-up window.
💻 Interactive GUI
Responsive buttons for operations.
A clean, keyboard-like layout.
Supports real-time computation and intuitive design.

📂 Project Structure
scientific_calculator_gui.py: Main Python script containing the implementation.
Dependencies: No external libraries are required apart from Python’s standard library.
💡 Usage Instructions
Input: Use the on-screen buttons to input numbers and select operations.
Operations:
Press = to compute the result.
Use C to clear the input field.
Advanced Functions:
For square root, logarithms, or trigonometric functions, input the value and press the corresponding button.
🔍 Example Calculations
Input	Operation	Output
25 + 5	Addition	30
√64	Square Root	8.0
log 100	Logarithm (base 10)	2.0
sin 90	Sine of 90 degrees	1.0
5!	Factorial of 5	120
🌟 Key Features in Detail
